# Software 
* <a href="https://gitlab.com/SCoRe-Group/APSPark">APSPark</a> is efficient and scalable All-Pairs Shortest-Path Solver for Apache Spark. On a modest Spark cluster (e.g., 1024 Intel Xeon cores), the solver can handle arbitrary undirected graphs with over 200,000 vertices.
* <a href="https://gitlab.com/SCoRe-Group/IsomapSpark/">IsomapSpark</a> is a tool to efficiently learn manifolds from large-scale high-dimensional data. The method is based on Isomap spectral dimensionality reduction and is implemented entirely in Apache Spark.
Visit the <a href="https://github.com/ubdsgroup/meads">MEADS github repository</a> for more software artifacts related to this project, including the code for this website.
